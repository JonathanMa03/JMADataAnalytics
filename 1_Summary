## Summary
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a bike-sharing program in Chicago, which has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles across 692 stations. The program offers pricing plans for casual riders (single-ride or full-day passes) and annual memberships for Cyclistic members. The finance team has determined that annual members are more profitable and the marketing team wants to convert more casual riders into members. They plan to analyze historical bike trip data to identify trends and understand why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.
