# Act: Key Findings and Recommendations
As reminder, the key limitation for this data was not being able to connect credit information to past purchases (in order to protect user privacy). This prevents us from knowing which casual riders live in the service area and which are travelers or tourists to the area. If the casual riders who live in the service area can be identified through another means that ensures user privacy, this could help the marketing team better target casual riders and convert them to member riders.
##
Regardless, there are insights that can be gleaned from the above analysis and help guide the actions of the marketing team to achieve the goal of converting casual riders to member riders. In particular, here are my top 3 recommendations:
##
We know that casual riders take rides of longer duration during the weekends. To encourage casual riders to become members, Cyclistic could partner with special events that occur on weekends. For example, they could partner with concert venues or sporting events.
##
Casual riders have their peak ride times during the months of April, May, and June. To encourage them to continue using the bike share service, special promotions for membership could be offer outside of peak times in effort to encourage them to continue using the service. This could also be applied during the work-week (M-F) when casual riders are less-likely to use the service.
##
Lastly, Cyclistic could partner with restaurants and recreational facilities near the Top 10 Start/End locations. As an example a discounted bike share membership could be offered when they purchase an item at a local business near these locations.
