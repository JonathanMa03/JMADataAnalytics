# Prepare
The data for the project is provided by Motivate International, Inc. under this license. NOTE: The data sets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company created for the purposes of the capstone project as determined by the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The data has been organized in monthly and quarterly periods. Since this project was started in April/May of 2022, the data from March 2021 to March 2022 has been selected.

# Limitations
The data has been de-personalized to safeguard the privacy of users. In particular, this means it is not possible to connect past purchases to credit card numbers and determine if casual riders live in the service area or purchased multiple single passes.
